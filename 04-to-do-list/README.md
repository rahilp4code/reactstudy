# Accordion Practice

This repository contains a basic accordion component built with React.  
It was created as a **beginning project and practice** while learning React concepts.

ðŸ‘‰ A **separate repository** has been made for the complete **To-Do List Web App**, which reflects the real progress and implementation of what Iâ€™ve learned.
